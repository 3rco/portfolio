Go through each category and determine which set of qualifiers best describes you in that category. By selecting the right qualifiers and submitting this form, you are able to construct your overall urcode.
    Some of the qualifiers will very probably not match with you exactly. It is impossible to cover all possibilities in each category. Simply choose that qualifier that most closely matches you. Each description of each qualifier describes the wide range of activities that apply, so as long as you match with one, you can probably use that qualifier.`,
